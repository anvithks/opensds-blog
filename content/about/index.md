<br>
An **open source** community working under **The Linux Foundation** to address storage integration challenges in scale-out cloud native environments. Its vision is to _connect siloed data solutions_ to build a self governed and intelligent data platform.

OpenSDS project was started towards the end of 2016 by a group of companies joined together to resolve key data management pain-points from storage vendors and end users. It was incubated as an open source project under The Linux Foundation to build a community to address those issues in a generic and standardized way.

Currently, there are multiple challenges and pain points due to siloed data/storage services. This projectâ€™s vision is to connect all the siloed data solutions to build a self-governed and intelligent data platform which is open, autonomous, ready and real.
